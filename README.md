# 🧠 Case Study for Customer Churn Prediction

This project is a **case study on Customer Churn Prediction** using **IBM SPSS Modeler**.  
It includes all key steps such as data preparation, model building, evaluation, and churn analysis.

---

## 📌 Objective
To predict which customers are most likely to leave (churn) based on their historical usage data and characteristics.

---

## 🧩 Steps Involved
1. **Data Import** – Loaded dataset (`telco x modeling data`) into SPSS Modeler.  
2. **Filtering** – Selected valid records where `DATA KNOW = YES`.  
3. **Type Node Setup** – Defined variable roles and assigned `churn` as target.  
4. **Model Building (CHAID)** – Created a CHAID decision tree model for churn prediction.  
5. **Deployment Data** – Imported `telco x deployment data` for scoring.  
6. **Prediction & Filtering** – Filtered customers with churn probability > 94%.  
7. **Output** – Displayed final churned customers list for business insight.
